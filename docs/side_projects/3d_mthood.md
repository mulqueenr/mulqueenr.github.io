### Introduction

Not to go full cooking blog in my description, but I wanted to give a shout out to the inspiration for this project. I was walking around the Oregon Convention Center during a winter craft festival and came across a booth with a really great local artist that goes by TimPlusApril. There were selling beautiful topographical map prints of Oregon mountains. They can be purchased [here.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/491138531/oregon-mountains-topographic-map-art?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_-art_and_collectibles&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQjwxJqHBhC4ARIsAChq4auyhaJXLQ4InKe10-dtyfBzqeF02XTUXafrZDXcosWE-Pq_1SdbBx4aAkRiEALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_12665398257_121762925993_511610210343_aud-1184785539738:pla-314954651933_c__491138531_102375588&utm_custom2=12665398257&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJqHBhC4ARIsAChq4auyhaJXLQ4InKe10-dtyfBzqeF02XTUXafrZDXcosWE-Pq_1SdbBx4aAkRiEALw_wcB)

This inspired me to generate similar prints but through a 3D printer to really capture the shadows and peaks across these neat-o mountains.

There are a bunch of different tutorials out there for using LIDAR or other public domain topographical data to generate landscapes and city scapes for 3d printing. I wanted to try my hand at it for a minimalistic wall piece.
This is the end result, with marble PLA glued to some cheap unfinished wood canvases. The whole project ended up costing a bit less than $10 per mountain. Support your local businesses if you can.

- Rubber Cement [link](https://www.amazon.com/Elmers-E904-Rubber-Cement-Repositionable/dp/B0141N3080/ref=asc_df_B0141N3080/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=507811518192&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5812764656112191763&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061081&hvtargid=pla-1404327488832&psc=1)

Required software
- Vector Graphics Software (I use adobe illustrator, but [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) works as a free substitute)
- Blender [link](https://www.blender.org/)
- BlenderGIS Plugin [link](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS)
- PrusaSlicer [link](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/)

Required equipment
- 3D Printer for PLA (I use an [Ender 3](https://creality3d.shop/collections/3d-printer/products/creality-ender-3-3d-printer-economic-ender-diy-kits-with-resume-printing-function-v-slot-prusa-i3-220x220x250mm?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJqHBhC4ARIsAChq4asvRZ1SKO8cVchx7G2DKHLPPB9m-PO0wEoWOUzAHXSXHzCbH6eKcekaAoMEEALw_wcB)

*Note: there are also tons of companies that will print things for you, but in the end just buying your own printer will end up being cheaper. Plus it opens the door for so many other projects!*

Here I generated a gallery of GIFs showing the step by step process from start to finish. I'll go into more detail below.
