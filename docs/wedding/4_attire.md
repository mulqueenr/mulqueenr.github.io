## What to wear

We're going for semi-formal dress. 
We want you to dress in what makes you feel fancy and ready to dance!


Keep in mind that most of the party will be in a barn in October in Maine, so make sure you have some warm layers if it gets chilly.
The ground is mostly lawn and likely uneven so no need for hard to walk in shoes. 
We're going for a juniper/sagebrush kind of color pallete. Similar to this website.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

(Astronaut suits are obviously encouraged.)
