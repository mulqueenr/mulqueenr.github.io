Also to provide a bit of guidance [here is the dress code.]({{site.baseurl}}/attire)

We would love friends and family to take as many photos leading up to and during the day as possible! We made a shared album for [you to contribute to here.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/XxYu8QQ1cNYYQwuU9)

Its crazy but somehow our families haven't met yet! To facilitate this, we provided a [dossier]({{site.baseurl}}/dossier) to peruse at your leisure to get to know other people invited to the party.
