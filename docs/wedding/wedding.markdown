## Welcome loved ones!

### Ryan and Casey are getting married! 

Thank you so much for being an important part of our lives and we want to celebrate our marriage with you!

The schedule of the day can be [found here.]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule)

Its crazy but somehow our families haven't met yet! 
To facilitate this, we provided a [dossier]({{site.baseurl}}/dossier) to peruse at your leisure to get to know other people invited to the party.

#### Things to know!
- Wear whatever makes you feel fancy, but if you need additional guidance [here is the dress code.]({{site.baseurl}}/attire)

- We would love friends and family to take as many photos leading up to and during the day as possible! 
We made a [shared album for you to contribute to here.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/XxYu8QQ1cNYYQwuU9)

- We won't have a full-service bar at the venue, but we will be providing plenty of beer, wine, premixed cocktails, and non-alcoholic drinks! Please feel free to bring any additional drinks.

- You can find some more information about [accomodations here!]({{site.baseurl}}/location) Or just ask us and we can try to help!
