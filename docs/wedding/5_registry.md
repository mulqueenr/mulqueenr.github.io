## Registry & Gifts

We are so grateful that you've all traveled so far to celebrate with us. Please don't feel obligated to get us anything - we made you drive to the woods. 

If you would like to give a monetary gift, please feel free to bring a card the day of, or we have set up a [Venmo wedding fund here.](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=1873878485827584235&created=1758412584)

We're going straight from the venue to our honeymoon in Acadia, and would prefer no physical gifts. However, if there is something you would love to give us, then please reach out for our shipping details.
